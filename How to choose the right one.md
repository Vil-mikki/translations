# How to choose the Right One

I understand that the following text may reach the emotional fabric of many people so please don't take this as an assault of your ideology. It is an attempt to sort out our (people's) views, feeling and inclinations.

Since childhood I have formed the opinion that everyone should marry only once. But who is she? :) How to realized you met The Right One? I guess many people (if not all) have this question in mind during their lifetime. It is a fundamental and critical one — it's features derive from our history and culture evolution.

Of course, nowadays it is ok to break up a marriage, but what is left at the end? Today people strive to avoid serious and irreversible choices, because of not wanting to take credit for their own decisions.
Go to Mars in one direction? Make a tattoo? Bind your life with someone forever? — «Yeah, but… maybe a little bit later, huh?»

And as it should be with such a inexplicablly incomprarable thing as «life», this sort of decisions shape and mold it bestowing everything with flavour and sensuality.

So I was getting similar answers on this subject: «you will feel that you met The Right One», «when you meet The Right One you will realized that you want to spend rest of life with her», «they [women] are all almost the same so just pick a suitable one and everything else will follow», «There is no difference — life will tell you when you will need it».

Sorry but I can't do it this way. How can it be so? First of all, it is obvious that there is a difference and according to it we have to choose. To better understand it just look at existing marriages — a lot of them are unhappy. It is not an alliance, but a burden of debt. So one of the goals here is to filter out the burden. It cuts out 2 typical answers.
If we look at it from this viewpoint (point of view), then the most powerful sensations become an indicator of makeing a choice. Right?

My experience shows that sensations are a feature of mind and our mind (brain) is very steep and powerful. So, one's power, sensations, thrills and comprehensiveness can be increased without any limits. Like, there are always things that our mind can interpret as more powerful and sensatious. Meanwhile, receiving sensations from the same stimulations changes in time, becomes less powerful. So, to rely on it in the process of decision making would be wrong (incorrect) in the long term.

What follows from all of it? Choosing a person from 7 billions — it is simply. As it usually is with many simple things, simplicity is not ease.
Based on my mistakes, my experience in dealing with society, stable long-term marriages, unhappy and tense marriages, couples, singles and my own «better halfs», I allocated the following aspects of feeling oneself with the person. Those aspects might give the answer: is it the right one?

## 1) Sex as a way of spiritual self-development, satisfaction of subconscious instincts and characteristics of thinking

It is not a secret that passion and sexual satisfaction is an important parameter. Nevertheless, often time might fade away a passion and people will try to restore it in many different ways. But «resurgence» is just the healing of symptoms.  
From my standpoint we should understand that strong passion and affection in their logical continuance — tremendous sexual satisfaction — are a temporary phenomenon, which evolves from a flirt and the other person's novelty.  
But it is something more persistent when it comes from oneself from within.  

When you recieve, when you give, when you share, when you evolve. Since this mutual process does not have any particulair limitations the progress here is infinite or at least can be very lasting.  
Thereof, when sex with the other person, every time, gives you possibilities for spiritual development, unity with something, it is an excellent indicator that this is not a temporary measure, but a corridor through which you can walk endlessly and discover the unknown. Together. This is about the brain and mental sensations, not physical.  

Also, all people have a set of complexes and instincts. Again, excellent if their satisfaction and compensation can occur through sex, through the other person.  This is another firm foundation for an endless pleasure from sex, indicator for its continuance.

## 2) The desire to encircle the other person with care and wishing only well, focus on the well — being of the other

Living for the couple like for your most dearest. You — it is the couple. The couple — it is you. But he/she is not you. Otherwise automatically one of the partners takes the social role of an exploiter, but the second one the role of the subordinate. Sooner or later both partners will get bored and prostrated, because of the balance being disturbed. This model already exists as a style of survival, but people become anxious.

## 3) You can be yourself, and the other person can be herself/himself with you

In the design of information systems is such a notion as little connectivity components. It is always a good thing. Components written less connected, are more stable, because they minimally rely on the neighbors, do not know anything about them, where they are or who they are. They are just functioning, no matter where and no matter who is nearby.
The same can be said about people in a couple. When you do not greatly impose your principles, rules, standards or set a certain frame on the other person, do not enforce your paradigm of perception. You're just more comfortable and more productive being next to this person and doing the same things as in solitary. This feature is easy to recognize if you silence your own ego and vanity.

## 4) Interest in the self-development and self-realization of the other person

This characteristic results from 2 previous points: if you are not to tightly bounded and you are not subordinating one another, the overall gains of the couple are based on the same values (which, however, do not plead the values and priorities of each). Like, playing in one team. Sooner or later it will become clear that playing in a pair, in a team always is advantageous, but later on will come the understanding that you really do not need to «play», at all. It is enough to promote the development and empowerment of the other person. Then the «game» in a pair (couple) will occur by itself and such an alliance would be psychologically strong, productive, presenting great opportunities for living in this world. Everyone in this lifetime can reach great heights by charging the other person and being charged by the other person, in a response. With such a force in your soul it is easy to be strong, staunch and receive everything you wish. To live as you wish. Isn't that the happiness of our being? Apart from the existence of children.

————————————————————————————————————————

Ah, children. I don't have them yet. I could go deeper into this topic, but if all 4 parameters are present in the relationship of a couple then there is a great background for children upbringing. And it is the most comfortable and healthy environment for both - parents and children.

All this does not negate the fact that a good indicator is immeasurable love for a person, feeling that your life is more harmonious and richer with her/him in it. But, however, those are just additional aspects that give you opportunity to analyze your decision.
Also an important point: raises your hand or not to put a ring on her finger. If it does — put it on. Otherwise don't. The presence of mind in important decision making does not mean the denial of intuition and soul.
